                    <p class="card-text">
                        Ah, you've discovered the great linguistic paradox of Dutch infrastructure! When a bridge "opens," it's actually closing for cars and opening for boats. It's like saying a door is "open" when it's blocking your hallway but letting a giraffe through the window. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Bridge opening = Cars stop, boats go. Bridge closing = Boats stop, cars go. Yes, it's backwards. No, we can't fix Dutch.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Because some boat owner bought a yacht with a mast taller than their ambitions. Also, commercial shipping needs to deliver your Amazon packages somehow. But mostly the yacht thing.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Nope! We track over 28,000 bridges across the entire Netherlands. That's roughly one bridge per 600 Dutch people, or approximately one bridge per 3,000 bicycles.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Welcome to the existential crisis every commuter faces! Your calendar is technically correct (the best kind of correct). The bridge IS opening... just not for you. Think of it as the bridge giving boats a high-five while leaving you hanging.

                    <h5 class="card-title">Q: How accurate are these opening times?</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The data comes straight from the NDW (Nationale Databank Wegverkeersgegevens), which is Dutch for "We Know When Bridges Ruin Your Day." They're usually spot-on, unless a particularly indecisive skipper is involved.

                        Yes! Subscribe to your personal calendar feed and get a 15-minute warning. That's enough time to dramatically sigh, find an alternate route, or practice your Dutch swear words.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Nope! We've gone full anarchist. No accounts, no passwords, no emails, no tracking. Just click <a href="/watchlist">Create Watchlist</a> and you'll get a unique URL like <code>clever-einstein</code> that you can bookmark and share.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        <strong>How it works:</strong> Your watchlist lives at its URL. Anyone with the link can view and edit it. It's like a shared Google Doc, but for bridge tracking. Revolutionary? Maybe. Convenient? Absolutely.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        <strong>Pro tip:</strong> You can also browse individual bridges at <a href="/bridges">Bridges</a> and subscribe to their calendars directly if you only need to track specific bridges.

                        Because "Bridge Opening Notification System for Preventing Aquatic-Induced Traffic Temporal Displacement Events" wouldn't fit on a business card. Plus, we ping you when bridges do their thing!

                        Yes, boats don't respect your leisure time. Some bridges have reduced schedules on weekends, but yacht owners gonna yacht.
